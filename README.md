# TicTacToe
This project is the conventional and simple Tic Tac Toe game that is developed in Python. It allows for two modes of play: single player against an AI and multiplayer between two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the players take turns marking their moves with 'X' and 'O' symbols.

This game was actually developed using the Google Collab environment. You can also run this file using Visual Studio Code.

Enjoy!
