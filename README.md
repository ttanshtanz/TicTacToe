The Tic Tac Toe game project is a classic implementation of the popular game, developed in Python. It offers two exciting modes of play: single-player - against an AI and multiplayer - between two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking their moves with 'X' and 'O' symbols.

It uses the popular algorithm - The MinMax Algorithm for its working.

The project is designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience. It can be easily run on various platforms, including Google Colab, Visual Studio Code, and other Python editors. 

Enjoy!
